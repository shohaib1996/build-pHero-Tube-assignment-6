            <p>  In JavaScript, variables are declared using the keywords <span class='font-bold'>var</span>, <span class="font-bold">let</span>, and <span
                class="font-bold">const</span>. Their behavior varies in terms of hoisting, reassignment, and block-level scope, and each of them has a unique scope. </p>
            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">var:</li>
            <p><span class="font-bold"> Scope:</span> Function-scoped.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Hoisting:</span> Variables defined using the var keyword are elevated to the top of the global context or the function that contains them. This means that even if you can use them before they are declared, their initial value will be undefined.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Reassignment:</span> Var-declared variables can be assigned new values..</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Block Scope:</span> There is no block-level scope for var. It only has application to the function or global context.</p>
            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">let:</li>
            <p class="font-bold"> Scope:</p> Block-scoped.
            <p class="font-bold">Hoisting:</p> There is no block-level scope for var. It only has application to the function or global context.
            <p class="font-bold">Reassignment:</p> Variables declared with let can be reassigned.
            <p class="font-bold">Block Scope:</p> Let has block-level scope, which means that it is limited to the block it is defined in, such as a loop, an if statement, or a function.

            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">const:</li>

            <p class="font-bold"> Scope:</p> Block-scoped.
            <p class="font-bold">Hoisting:</p> const variables are also raised, but like let variables, they are not initialized, so accessing them before declaration will result in a Reference Error.
            <p class="font-bold">Reassignment:</p> You can't change variables declared with const after they've been initialized. But for objects and fields, you can't change the reference, but you can change the content.

            <li class="font-bold">Intentional Absence of a Value: 
            </li>
            <p>Most commonly, NULL is used to indicate the intentional absence of an object value or a substitute for an object that does not exist or does not yet have a value.
            </p>
            <li class="font-bold">Explicitly Assigned: 
            </li>
            <p>When you want to indicate that a variable or a property has no value, you assign null to it.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Use Cases: 
            </li>
            <p>Some of the most common ways to initialize variables or properties include:

                marking an object as not being in an array
                
                marking a variable or a property as not having a value
                
                marking it as not having a state

        <li class=" list-decimal bg-sky-400 text-white p-4 font-bold">undefined:</li>
        <div class="">
            <li class="font-bold">Default Initial Value:
            </li>
            <p>Declared variables are automatically assigned an undefined value. Function parameters that do not have an argument also have an undefined value.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Property Value Not Present:
            </li>
            <p>When you access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns undefined.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Use Cases:
            </li>
            <p> In general, it is used to check whether a variable has been set, if a function argument has been passed, and if an object property has been passed.</p>

        <p class="text-center">REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a collection of architectural concepts and constraints that are used to design and interact with web services.

REST API is a popular way to build web services that are easy to scale, easy to maintain, and easy to use.

Web and mobile applications often use REST API to communicate between software systems over the Internet.</p>
