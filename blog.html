            <p><span class='font-bold'>var</span>, <span class="font-bold">let</span>, and <span
                    class="font-bold">const</span> are keywords used in JavaScript to declare variables. Each of them
                has a different scope, and their behavior varies in terms of hoisting, reassignment, and block-level
                scope. </p>
            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">var:</li>
            <p><span class="font-bold"> Scope:</span> Function-scoped.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Hoisting:</span> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
                containing function or global context. This means you can use them before they are declared, but they
                will have an initial value of undefined.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Reassignment:</span> Variables declared with var can be reassigned.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Block Scope:</span> var doesn't have block-level scope. It's only scoped to the
                function or global context.</p>
            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">let:</li>
            <p class="font-bold"> Scope:</p> Block-scoped.
            <p class="font-bold">Hoisting:</p> Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they are not
            initialized. If you try to
            access them before declaration, you'll get a ReferenceError.
            <p class="font-bold">Reassignment:</p> Variables declared with let can be reassigned.
            <p class="font-bold">Block Scope:</p> let has block-level scope, meaning it's confined to the
            block it's defined in, such as
            loops, if statements, or functions.

            <li class="list-decimal text-white bg-amber-500 p-5 font-bold">const:</li>

            <p class="font-bold"> Scope:</p> Block-scoped.
            <p class="font-bold">Hoisting:</p> Variables declared with const are also hoisted, but like let,
            they are not initialized.
            Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
            <p class="font-bold">Reassignment:</p> Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are
            initialized. However,
            for objects and arrays, the reference cannot be changed, but the content can be modified.

            and they are often used in different contexts for different purposes. </h2>
            <p class="text-2xl bg-purple-500 text-white max-w-lg mx-auto my-5 text-center font-bold">the use cases of null and undefined</p>
        <li class=" list-decimal bg-sky-400 text-white p-4 font-bold">null:</li>
        <div class="">
            <li class="font-bold">Intentional Absence of a Value: 
            </li>
            <p>null is typically used to represent the intentional
                absence of any object value or a placeholder for an object that doesn't exist or has no value yet.
            </p>
            <li class="font-bold">Explicitly Assigned: 
            </li>
            <p>You assign null to a variable or property when you want to
                indicate that it has no meaningful value.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Use Cases: 
            </li>
            <p>Common use cases include initializing variables or properties,
                indicating the absence of an object in an array, or resetting a variable or property to a non-value
                state.</p>
        </div>
        <li class=" list-decimal bg-sky-400 text-white p-4 font-bold">undefined:</li>
        <div class="">
            <li class="font-bold">Default Initial Value:
            </li>
            <p>Variables that are declared but not assigned a value are automatically assigned undefined. Function
                parameters that are not provided with an argument also have the value undefined.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Property Value Not Present:
            </li>
            <p>When you access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns undefined.</p>
            <li class="font-bold">Use Cases:
            </li>
            <p> Common use cases include checking if a variable has been initialized, checking if a function argument
                has been provided, and checking if an object property exists.</p>

        <p class="text-center">REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints used for designing and interacting with web services. It is a popular approach for building web services that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand. RESTful APIs are commonly used in web and mobile applications to facilitate communication between different software systems over the internet.</p>
